of nerve cell tissue.<BR>

<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through your genes). Thatâ€™s because it can result from a sudden mutation (change) in your genes.
Mutations that lead to neurofibromatosis include:<BR>
<h3><I>RISK FACTORS</I></h3>
The only true risk factor for developing neurofibromatosis is having a parent who also has the condition. In nearly half of all cases of type 1 and type 2 
neurofibromatosis, and in around 15 percent of schwannomatosis cases, the condition is passed down from parent to child.<BR>
