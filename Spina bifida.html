SPINA BIFIDA</h1>

<body>
Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure in 
a developing embryo that eventually becomes the baby's brain, spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them.Typically, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy and it 
closes by the 28th day after conception.<BR>
