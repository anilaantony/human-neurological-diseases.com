MILLER FISHER SYNDROME</h1>
</head>
<body>
Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a rare acquired nerve disease related to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Features include weakness of the eye muscles causing difficulty
moving the eyes; impaired limb coordination and unsteadiness; and absent tendon reflexes. Other symptoms may include facial, swallowing and limb weakness, as well as
respiratory failure. MFS can affect both children and adults. It often occurs several days (up to four weeks) after a bacterial or viral illness. MFS is rare, 
affecting one to two people per million each year. It is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks the nerves. Specific treatment is available but most
patients recover within six months even without treatment. Very few patients have permanent neurological problems or relapse. Death is very rare.<BR>

<h3><I>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</I></h3
ophthalmoplegia (eye muscle weakness resulting in impaired eye movements and consequent double vision)<BR>
ataxia (incoordination of the limbs)<BR>
areflexia (absence of tendon reflexes)<BR>
<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
MFS is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies against a bacterial or viral infection cross-react with and attack the nerves. The site of attack may be the myelin 
sheaths, which insulate and protect the nerve fibers (axons), or the axons themselves. The principal autoantibody is directed against a molecule called ganglioside 
GQ1b, which is especially present on the nerves affected. The antibody is present in the blood of at least 80% of people with MFS and can be used to confirm the 
diagnosis.<BR>
<h3><I>RISK FACTORS</I></h3>
Men. The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association notes that men are twice as likely to have MFS as women.<BR>
People who are of middle age. The mean age of developing MFS is 43.6 years.<BR>
People who are Taiwanese or Japanese. According to a case reportTrusted Source published in the Hawai‘i Journal of Medicine & Public Health, 19 percent of GBS cases 
in Taiwan fall under the MFS category. That number jumps to 25 percent in Japan.<BR>
<h3><I>COMPLICATIONS</I></h3> 
Weakness of your eye muscles which leads to double vision and difficulty controlling eye movements
(ophthalmoplegia) Problems with limb coordination (ataxia) Loss of reflexes in your tendons (areflexia)<BR>
