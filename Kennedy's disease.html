KENNEDY'S DISEASE</h1>
</head>
<body>
Kennedy's disease is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles, particularly the arms and legs.Kennedy's 
disease is caused by a genetic mutation of the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome.<BR>

<h3><I>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</I></H3>
<UL>
<LI>swallowing difficulties
<LI>speech difficulties
<LI>shaky muscles when holding certain postures
<LI>muscle weakness
<LI>enlarged calf muscles due to constant cramping
<LI>localised areas of numbness
<LI>absent reflexes, such as the foot remaining still when the tendon beneath the kneecap is tapped
<LI>enlarged breast tissue (gynaecomastia)
<LI>impotence
</UL>
<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
Kennedy disease is a gradually progressive, neuromuscular disorder characterized by wasting of the proximal muscles (those closer to the trunk) and bulbar muscles 
(those of the face and throat).The condition mainly affects males, with onset between the ages of 30 and 60. Early symptoms may include tremor, muscle cramps, and 
muscle twitching. This is followed by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, which may manifest in a variety of ways.Affected people may also have gynecomastia, 
testicular atrophy (reduction in size or function of the testes), and reduced fertility as a result of mild androgen insensitivity. Kennedy disease is caused by a 
mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.<BR>
<h3><I>RISK FACTORS</I></h3>
<UL>
<LI>swallowing difficulties.
<LI>speech difficulties.
<LI>hand tremors.
<LI>shaky muscles when holding certain postures.
<LI>muscle weakness.
<LI>muscle wastage.
<LI>muscle twitches.
<LI>muscle cramps and spasms.
</UL>
<h3><I>PREVENTION</I></h3>
There is no cure for Kennedy's disease, because medical science doesn't know how to regenerate muscle neurones. Treatment aims to ease some of the symptoms and can 
include: medications to reduce muscle cramps and tremors<BR>
