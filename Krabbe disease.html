KRABBE DISEASE</h1>
</head>
<body>
Krabbe (KRAH-buh) disease is an inherited disorder that destroys the protective coating (myelin) of nerve cells in the brain and throughout the nervous system. 
 It is also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy.<BR>

<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
Krabbe disease is caused when a person inherits two copies of an altered (mutated) gene — one copy from each parent.
A gene provides a kind of blueprint for producing proteins. If there is an error in this blueprint, then the protein product may not work properly. In the case of 
Krabbe disease, two mutated copies of a particular gene result in little or no production of an enzyme called galactocerebrosidase (GALC).Enzymes, such as GALC, are 
responsible for breaking down certain substances in a cell's recycling center (lysosome). In Krabbe disease, the short supply of GALC enzymes results in the 
accumulation of certain types of fats called galactolipids.<BR>
<h3><I>RISK FACTORS</I></h3>
The gene mutation associated with Krabbe disease only causes the disease if two mutated copies of the gene are inherited. A disease resulting from two mutated copies 
is called an autosomal recessive disorder.<BR>
<h3><I>COMPLICATIONS</I></h3>
A number of complications — including infections and respiratory difficulties
Most children who develop Krabbe disease in infancy die before the age of 2, most often from respiratory failure or complications of immobility and markedly decreased
muscle tone. Children who develop the disease later in childhood may have a somewhat longer life expectancy, usually between two and seven years after diagnosis.<BR>
<h3><I>PREVENTION</I></h3>
There's no cure for Krabbe disease, and treatment focuses on supportive care. However, stem cell transplants have shown some success in infants who are treated before 
the onset of symptoms and in some older children and adults.<BR>
