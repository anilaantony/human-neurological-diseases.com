GUILLAIN BARRE SYNDROME</h1>
</head>
<body>
Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves. Weakness and tingling in your extremities are
usually the first symptoms.These sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body.The exact cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome is unknown. But two-thirds of patients
report symptoms of an infection in the six weeks preceding. These include respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection or Zika virus.There's no known cure for
Guillain-Barre syndrome, but several treatments can ease symptoms and reduce the duration of the illness. <BR>

<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
The disorder usually appears days or weeks after a respiratory or digestive tract infection. Rarely, recent 
surgery or vaccination can trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome.<BR> 
In Guillain-Barre syndrome, your immune system — which usually attacks only invading organisms — begins attacking the nerves. In AIDP, the most common form of 
Guillain-Barre syndrome in the U.S., the nerves' protective covering (myelin sheath) is damaged. The damage prevents nerves from transmitting signals to your brain, 
causing weakness, numbness or paralysis.<BR>
