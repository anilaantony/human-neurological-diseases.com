MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</h1>
</head>
<body>
MS is the most common acquired chronic neurological disease affecting young adults, often diagnosed between the ages of 20 to 40 and, in Australia, affects three 
times more women than men.The body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the fatty material – called myelin – around the nerves. Myelin is important for 
protecting and insulating nerves so that the electrical messages that the brain sends to the rest of the body, travel quickly and efficiently.As the myelin breaks 
down during a MS attack – a process called demyelination – patches of nerves become exposed and then scarred, which render the nerves unable to communicate messages 
properly and at risk of subsequent degeneration.<BR>

<h3><I>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</I></H3>

<LI>Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait
<LI>Prolonged double vision
<LI>Blurry vision
<LI>Slurred speech

<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this 
immune system malfunction destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord (myelin).
Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel 
along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked.<BR>
