ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</h1>
</head>
<body>
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that causes the brain to shrink (atrophy) and brain cells to die. Alzheimer's disease is the most common 
cause of dementia â€” a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that affects a person's ability to function independently.
As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimer's disease will develop severe memory impairment and lose the ability to carry out everyday tasks.
Medications may temporarily improve or slow progression of symptoms. These treatments can sometimes help people with Alzheimer's disease maximize
function and maintain independence for a time. Different programs and services can help support people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.<BR>

<h3><I>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</I></H3>
Memory loss<BR>
Challenges in solving problems<BR>
Difficulty completing familiar tasks<BR>
Confusion <BR>
<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
At a basic level, brain proteins fail to function normally, which disrupts the work of brain
cells (neurons) and triggers a series of toxic events. Neurons are damaged, lose connections to each other and eventually die.
The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory, but the process begins years before the first symptoms.The loss of neurons spreads in a 
somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brains. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk significantly.<BR>
