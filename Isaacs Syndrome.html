ISAACS SYNDROME</h1>
</head>
<body>
Isaacs' syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness; continuously contracting or twitching muscles (myokymia); and 
diminished reflexes. Signs and symptoms generally develop between ages 15 and 60, with most people experiencing symptoms before age 40. Although the exact underlying 
cause is unknown, there appear to be hereditary and acquired (non-inherited) forms of the condition<BR>

<h3><I>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</I></H3>
Progressive stiffness, cramping and weakness<BR>
Delayed muscle relaxation<BR>
Diminished reflexes<BR>
Muscle atrophy<BR>
Increased sweating<BR>
<h3><I>CAUSES</I></h3>
There appear to be hereditary and acquired (non-inherited) forms of the condition. The acquired forms are often associated with malignancies, peripheral neuropathies,
and a variety of autoimmune disorders of the nervous system.<BR>
<h3><I>RISK FACTORS</I></h3>
Progressive stiffness, cramping and weakness<BR>
Muscle twitching with a rippling appearance (myokymia)<BR>
Delayed muscle relaxation<BR>
Diminished reflexes<BR>
Muscle atrophy<BR>
Increased sweating<BR>
<h3><I>COMPLICATIONS</I></h3>
continuous contracting or twitching of muscles<BR>
muscle stiffness and cramping that worsens over time<BR>
increased or excessive sweating<BR>
delayed reflexes<BR>
gradual muscle loss<BR>
difficulty coordinating movements and walking<BR>
weight loss<BR>
increased calf muscle size<BR>
elevated heart rate<BR>
<h3><I>PREVENTION</I></h3>
anticonvulsant medications, such as valproic acid, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine<BR>
plasma exchange<BR>
oral corticosteroids, such as prednisolone<BR>
nonsteroidal drugs that suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate and azathioprine<BR>
acetazolamide<BR>
